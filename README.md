# CoffeeLdr

CoffeeLdr is a loader for so called Beacon Object Files. 
This project can be used for testing Beacon Object files without using the Cobalt Strike framework or
can be used to give custom implants a way to execute BOFs that where designed for Cobalt strike.
But most of the Beacon Api (fork&run and injection) functions are empty for custom implementations.

Of course this would never be possible without the project from Trustedsec called [COFFLoader](https://github.com/trustedsec/COFFLoader)
